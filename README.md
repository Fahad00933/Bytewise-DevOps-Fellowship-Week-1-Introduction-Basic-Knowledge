# What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery. The DevOps culture emphasizes collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations teams to automate and streamline the software delivery process, from code development to deployment and maintenance.


# Problems that became reasons of evolution of DevOps?
DevOps emerged as a response to the traditional software development lifecycle (SDLC), which was characterized by siloed teams and a slow, linear process of development, testing, and deployment. This traditional SDLC approach often led to delays, errors, and inefficiencies in software delivery.


# History of DevOps?
The history of the evolution of the SDLC and DevOps culture can be traced back to the Waterfall model, which was the dominant approach to software development in the 1970s and 1980s. The Waterfall model was a linear, sequential process that involved distinct phases of requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment. Each phase was completed before moving on to the next, and any changes or issues that arose during development had to be addressed in subsequent phases.

In the 1990s, the Agile Manifesto was introduced as an alternative to the Waterfall model. The Agile approach emphasized collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development cycles. This approach led to the development of various Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, which focused on delivering software in small, incremental releases.

In the early 2000s, the DevOps movement began to emerge as a response to the challenges of Agile development. DevOps aimed to bridge the gap between development and operations teams and improve the speed and quality of software delivery. DevOps emphasized automation, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and collaboration between development and operations teams.

# Present and Future of DevOps
Today, DevOps has become an essential part of software development and IT operations, with many organizations adopting DevOps practices to improve their software delivery processes. DevOps culture is centered around continuous improvement, collaboration, and feedback, with a focus on delivering software that meets the needs of customers and end-users.
